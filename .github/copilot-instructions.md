# MazeFi Development Guidelines

This is a Web3-based maze puzzle game built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game focuses on:

1. **Maze Generation**: Progressive difficulty with procedurally generated mazes
2. **Web3 Integration**: MetaMask wallet connection without blockchain transactions
3. **Token Rewards**: Simulated $MZFI token rewards for completed levels
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with touch controls
5. **Performance**: Optimized rendering for various maze sizes

## Key Technologies
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Context API for state management
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Web3 wallet integration (MetaMask)

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Maintain clean component architecture

## Game Mechanics
- Player movement with keyboard (WASD/arrows) and touch controls
- Progressive maze difficulty scaling with levels
- Token rewards based on completion time and level
- Leaderboard system with local storage
- No actual blockchain transactions (simulation only)
